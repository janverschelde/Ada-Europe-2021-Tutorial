# AdaEuropeTutorial

The four folders correspond to the four parts of an online tutorial,
at the Ada Europe 2021 conference, on 7 June 2021,
about programming parallel shared memory computers.

1. Introduction: declaring and defining tasks that execute in parallel.

2. WorkCrew: tasks collaborate to process a queue of jobs.

3. Pipelining: delegating work in a pyramid pipeline of tasks.

4. Sychronization: arrays of producers and consumers synchronize with a shared data structure.

The code was developed with the GNAT Community compiler.
